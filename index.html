    <pre>
      we found wonderland
      and you and i got lost in it.
      didn't they tell us don't rush into things didn't you
      flash your green eyes at me.
    </pre>

  <p>we can also use a line break.<br>

    As it turns out, size matters. When we search through scenes for a particular object, we often miss even giant targets when their size is inconsistent with the rest of the scene. Thatâ€™s according to scientists at UC Santa Barbara, where this curious phenomenon is being investigated in an effort to better understand how humans conduct visual searches.
