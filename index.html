  <h1>The language automatically deletes all the white space</h1>
  <p style="text-align:right;font-family:courier;color:blue;font-size:50px;">but we can use the pre tagline to preserve formatting:-
    <pre>
      we found wonderland
      and you and i got lost in it.
      didn't they tell us don't rush into things didn't you
      flash your green eyes at me.
    </pre>
  </p>
  <p>we can also use a line break.<br>
    we found wonderland,<br>
    and you and i got lost in it.<br>
    didn't they tell us don't rush into things,<br> didn't you
    flash your green eyes at me.
